## 🌟 Overview

Votta is an e-voting system that ensures security, transparency, and privacy for all voters. Built on blockchain technology and featuring zero-knowledge proofs, it safeguards your voting data while allowing trusted verification.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Votta uses a layered architecture. The core of the system includes smart contracts that handle voting logic securely, while off-chain services manage user interactions. This structure allows for greater flexibility and reduced risks.

## 📜 Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms written directly in code. In Votta, they guarantee that votes cannot be altered once cast. This ensures the integrity of the voting process.

## 🌐 Off-Chain Services

Our off-chain services support user management and data storage. They handle requests from users, including registration, vote casting, and result retrieval, while interacting seamlessly with the blockchain.
